# World Food and Population Project
## The problem
<q>Population growth is the increase in the number of people in a population or dispersed group. Global human population growth amounts to around 83 million annually, or 1.1% per year. The global population has grown from 1 billion in 1800 to 7.9 billion in 2020. The UN projected population to keep growing, and estimates have put the total population at 8.6 billion by mid-2030, 9.8 billion by mid-2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100.</q>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The more the people, the more the food they need. 
The more the food, the more natural resources are exploited.

            <br>

Two of them, where provived by the client, i decided to include a third one.



<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dorbicycle/world-foodfeed-production">FAO</a>.csv file: <b>provided</b>, it contains data about worldwide food and feed production from 1961 to 2013.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selfvivek/environment-impact-of-food-production">Food Production</a>.csv file: <b>provided</b>, it contains data about quantities of natural resources exploitation and pollution levels that are produced in the various steps of the production chain of 43 of the most produced foods in the world.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/world-population-19602018">World population</a>.csv file: <b>added by my self</b>, it cointains data about world population density by country from 1960 to 2017.
